 *
 * NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument to not get warnings.

/**
 * @brief Wait for all queued jobs to finish
 *

 * (probably the main program) will continue.
 *
 * Smart polling is used in wait. The polling is initially 0 - meaning that
 * there is virtually no polling at all. If after 1 seconds the threads
 * haven't finished, the polling interval starts growing exponentially
 * untill it reaches max_secs seconds. Then it jumps down to a maximum polling
 * interval assuming that heavy processing is being used in the threadpool.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *    ..
 *    threadpool thpool = iot_thpool_init(4);
 *    ..
 *    // Add a bunch of work
 *    ..
 *    iot_thpool_wait(thpool);
